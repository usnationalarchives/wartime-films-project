By exploring newly digitized and remastered films and images from a variety of sources, you can now build and share locally-resonant stories about World War I and its aftermath. The app features selections from the US National Archives’ Wartime Films collection, consisting of several hundred reels of film originally shot by the US Signal Corps on behalf of various armed forces units in the 1914–1920 timeframe. These silent films depict training and patriotic activities on the homefront in the US, as well as scenes from the war in Europe and other world arenas. We will supplement these films by hundreds or thousands of images from the same time period." FontFamily="TrebuchetMS" TextColor="White" FontSize="20"></Label>
