# Wartime Films Project

### Overview

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has received a grant for the digitization, preservation, and online publication of 100,000 rarely seen World War I still images and hundreds of moving images from World War I and World War II. These images are all available in the Public Domain. We’re engaging communities interested in utilizing this content and data, assessing and understanding the needs of these communities in relation to content and enrichment tools, and focusing on content releases that will provide the greatest opportunity for **discovery**, **enrichment** and **reuse** amongst the broadest possible audiences. This project is tentatively called the Wartime Films Project.

We hope to work with large scale downloads of select World War I still image metadata in order to organize and enrich the Wartime Films Project, by parsing out events, regiments, thematic tags, etc., and adding latitudes and longitudes based on existing location information. We’d like your help in making and sharing improvements to this data. We’d also like to hear how you’ve been able to use the data for your own projects and hope you’ll share your modifications of the data for the benefit of the National Archives and other researchers, scholars, genealogists, and enthusiasts.

NARA is invested in the movement to advance an ecosystem of open archival data, which provides the possibility for communities, domain experts, technologists and others to build useful tools and services around public cultural heritage data and content. The Wartime Films Project is built around public domain data and content, which allows us to leverage open source technology and create multiple ways to enrich and share these collections in new ways.
